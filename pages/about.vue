        I'm a CTO and web developer living in Portland, OR. In Mid-2019 that I first came across notion.
        I was blown away by it's power, but also intimidated at how to get started using it.
        Thanks to people like Maria Poulaine, Khe Hy, Tiago Forte, and August Bradley
        I've learned a ton about how to use Notion in ways I didn't even understand were possible when I first got started.
        I've wanted to give back ever since. <span class="italic">So Notion!</span> is my attempt to do just that.
